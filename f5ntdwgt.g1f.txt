edit eab64b1 Possible moves displayed on the board. The player can unselect a piece. The controller can detect when the player makes a possible move, and will tell it to the model (first we need to create a function in Board.java to move a piece). Started the construction of an observer to get the updates of the board.

# Rebase a1b2c41..eab64b1 onto a1b2c41 (10 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
